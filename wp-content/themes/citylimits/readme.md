## "Mapping the Future"/"ZoneIn"/"Rezone"

The former name of the "Mapping the Future" series was "ZoneIn", which is reflected in many places in the code, as `zonein` in the names of functions, elements, partials, styles, and other places. It should remain "Mapping the Future" in human-facing output, but can remain "zonein" in IDs, functions, styles, and so on.

See https://github.com/INN/umbrella-citylimits/issues/30

The former name of "ZoneIn" was "Rezone".
